The way I see it, developers &amp; press both have the same goal: to bring great games to as many people as possible. For the press, finding out about a game but not having access to information &amp; media for the game means that they still can\'t really write something about it. Developers want to spend their valuable time making games instead of press pages, resulting in that so many games that could\'ve touched so many hearts didn\'t end up doing so. </p>');
